## Overview
Autoencoder model for the conversion of solo singing to choir singing. This repository just documents our initial attempts and experimentation. The final model was made using a WGAN; you can find it [here](https://github.com/kraftedcheese/deepest-learning/tree/main) (contains all the documentation, etc.).

## Output samples
Output samples for this initial experimentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12LnAslQwYVEZF2sJ9CWPF0vpjwSIj5yy?usp=sharing).
